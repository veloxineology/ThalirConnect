## 🔒 Secure Login via Whatsapp/Telegram (Coming Soon)

To ensure the privacy and safety of our users, ThalirConnect implements a **login-based system**:

1. **Unique Code** Generation: When the app is installed on the child/elder's device, it generates a unique login code.
2. **Secure Login**: The caregiver enters the unique code into their device via Telegram/Whatsapp to establish a secure connection.
